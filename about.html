                FTS in association with “Janta Seva Mandal, Ballia Uttar Pradesh”, has been started in 2020 to serve people by normalising failures and uplifting an individual’s growth !! We are here to make people share not just their success stories,but also their failures. Each one of us can play a role in shifting how we collectively view failure by sharing the stories of how we failed. The more we talk about and hear stories of failure, the more at ease we will be about putting our toe in the water, raising our hand, trying that new thing and taking the leap. Stop keeping failures hidden. Let’s bring them out into the light and see them for what they really are…opportunities for learning and growing.
